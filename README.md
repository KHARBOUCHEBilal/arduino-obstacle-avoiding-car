# Arduino Obstacle-Avoiding Car

**Description**: An Arduino-based project that implements an obstacle-avoiding car using ultrasonic sensors. The car detects obstacles in its path and autonomously navigates around them, demonstrating basic robotics and sensor integration.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- DC Motors and Motor Driver (L298N)
- Chassis for the car
- Wheels
- Power Supply (Battery pack)
- Jumper wires

## Code
The Arduino code for controlling the car can be found in the `main.ino` file.

## Usage
1. Assemble the car according to the schematic.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the car and place it on the ground to see it navigate around obstacles.
